## Spanda Boot Camp Day 2


<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Part 1**</span>

**We will cover:**



* How to handle the growing scale in large-scale machine learning applications
* We will identify  patterns needed to build scalable and reliable distributed systems
* We will outline the use of these patterns in distributed systems and building reusable patterns

**Part 1 Outcome:**



* You will be able to choose and apply the correct patterns for building and deploying distributed machine learning systems; use common tooling viz., 
    * TensorFlow ([https://www.tensorflow.org)](https://www.tensorflow.org/), 
    * Kubernetes [(https://kubernetes.io)](https://kubernetes.io/), 
    * Kubeflow ([https://www.kubeflow.org)](https://www.kubeflow.org/), 
    * Argo Workflows 
* appropriately within a machine learning workflow; and gain practical experience in managing and automating machine learning tasks in Kubernetes. 
* The project  we will explore later will help us learn to build a real-life distributed machine learning system using the patterns we study. 

**ML Scale**



* The scale of machine learning applications has become unprecedentedly large. Case in point: LLMs
* Users are demanding faster responses to meet real-life requirements, and machine learning pipelines and model architectures are getting more complex.
* Due to the growing demand and complexity, machine learning systems have to be built with the ability to handle the growing scale, including the increasing volume of historical data; frequent batches of incoming data; complex machine learning architectures; heavy model serving traffic; and complicated end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
